        <h3>Week 1: 9/2/2021 - 9/9/2021</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Get set up with VSCode using<br>

            </li>
            <li>Finish looking through and completing any given tutorial by Dr. Bart <a href=https://udel.instructure.com/courses/1601987/pages/portfolio-description?module_item_id=21557713>Here</a> (Might not load because Canvas Link)</li>
            <li>Learn to use Typescript with this <a href=https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-practical-guide-to-typescript-how-to-build-a-pokedex-app-using-html-css-and-typescript>Pokedex Tutorial</a></li>
            <li>
                Currently, I intend on building a website similar to what one of my friends, Michael Young, has built <a href =https://runeflip.herokuapp.com>https://runeflip.herokuapp.com</a> I wasn’t
                 sure if herokuapp provided more functionality than Github pages, so I intend to try it out and see which I like most. After I figure this 
                 project out with the OldSchool Runescape API, I want to make a webpage that tracks my stock investments without the need for my brokerage app.
            </li>
            <li>It might be possible in the future to make the Pokedex subpages myself and further use the API to grab stats and descriptions.</li>
            <li>Trying to learn React by following a tutorial on how to make TicTacToe, guide can be found <a href=https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html>Here</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Week 2: 9/10/2021 - 9/16/2021</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Must learn how to dynamically resize my picture when the window shrinks.
            <li>I might drop the TicTacToe project <a href=https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html>Here</a>, doesn’t seem all too interesting, but I just want to find a good guide/tutorial for React</li>
            <li>Move all of my portfolio from Markdown to HTML for better organization</li>
            <li>Add all of the provided tutorials from Dr. Bart to the home page in collapsible divs using <a href=https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_collapsible.asp>W3Schools guide</a></li>
            <li>Learn CSS and how to separate styles for header and body images (Figured this out myself by appending header in front of CSS rules)</li>
            <li>Add bulleted lists using <a href=https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp>W3Schools</a></li>
            <li>Yes, I practically spent this whole week on HTML, CSS, and JS to get this website how I wanted it.</li>
            <li>Attend Lab on 9/14/2021 with TA L.B. to further learn the wonders of Git</li>
            <li>Built TicTacToe in React near midnight, tired. Must add CSS styling to make it look appealing</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Week 3: 9/17/2021 - 9/23/2021</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Add finishing touches for CSS and HTML formatting to this portfolio</li>
            <li>Begin development of Typescript project TrustFlip that I wanted to do from week 1</li>
            <li>Improve use of development branches and merging of branches</li>
            <li>I want to develop a React App for Checkers.</li>
            <li>Found a JS guide for checkers in React, I am transitioning it into TS to learn about the nuances and benefits of using TS</li>
            <li>UPDATE: Got feedback from class assignment, focus more on React. Anything I planned on doing in something other than React, 
                such as the TrustFlip project that pulls Runescape API market data, will now be done in React.
            </li>
            <li>I found a random link for a Password Strength Checker in TS React while looking for Checkers, decided to make it. <a href=https://www.kindacode.com/article/react-typescript-password-strength-checker-example/#The_Code>kindacode.com</a></li>
            <li>Make the progress bar change colors as password gets increasingly long</li>
            <li>Don't know if it is worth the time investment, but making the password checker account for symbols instead of purely length, would be a huge improvement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Week 4: 9/24/2021 - 9/30/2021</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Start working on TrustFlip. Gonna be a big project for the next few days.</li>

        </ul>
