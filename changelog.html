        <p>
        <h3>9/11/2021</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Site initialized and Home index is the only page. Added some basic CSS styling and side by side panels for header</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>9/12/2021</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Created "Change Log" and "To Do" indexes and set up button links to them. Will not be moving over Change Log from Previous
                portfolio because this is a new project. Will be copying over and updating "To Do."</li> 
        
            <li>Added new images to Change Log and To Do to give some more life to the pages.</li>
            <li>Added some more tabs to the Home page, completed some of the beginner tutorial things/readings and put them on the home page, tried adding nested
        collapsible div containers, it isn't working properly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>9/13/2021</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>I got the nested lists to WORK in Home, very happy. UPDATE - the nested list when expanded hides the items at the bottom of the list...</li>
        need to find a fix...
        <li>Added a scrolling functionality to see previously obscured content. Not the way I'd like it, but it works for now.</li>
        <li>Added Tabs on home page with every single provided resource from Dr. Bart, I will be adding to these with my own sites that I utilize from now on
        to document my growth. Put "Complete." or "Incomplete" depending on my current status with that resource.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>9/14/2021</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Heavily updated To Do with information from past portfolio, added removed data for historical evidence.</li>
            <li>Added bulleted unordered lists to Change Log and To Do to organize information</li>
            <li>Updated Home page resources with more info, what I learned, how I used it, etc</li>
            <li>Added spacing in the change log between dates for readability.</li>
        </ul>
