        <h1 style="text-align: center";>Change Log</h1>
        <p>
        9/11/2021 - Site initialized and Home index is the only page. Added some basic CSS styling and side by side panels for header
        </br>9/12/2021 - Created "Change Log" and "To Do" indexes and set up button links to them. Will not be moving over Change Log from Previous
                portfolio because this is a new project. Will be copying over and updating "To Do."
        </br>Added new images to Change Log and To Do to give some more life to the pages.
        </br>Added some more tabs to the Home page, completed some of the beginner tutorial things/readings and put them on the home page, tried adding nested
        collapsible div containers, it isn't working properly.
        </br>9/13/2021 - I got the nested lists to WORK in Home, very happy. UPDATE - the nested list when expanded hides the items at the bottom of the list...
        need to find a fix...
        </br>Added a scrolling functionality to see previously obscured content. Not the way I'd like it, but it works for now.
        </br>Added Tabs on home page with every single provided resource from Dr. Bart, I will be adding to these with my own sites that I utilize from now on
        to document my growth. Put "Complete." or "Incomplete" depending on my current status with that resource.
